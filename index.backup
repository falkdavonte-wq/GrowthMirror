  <h2>Our Story ‚Ä¢ Origins ‚Ä¢ Vision</h2>
  <div class="story-content">
    <p>GrowthMirror began as a seed of self-reflection ‚Äî a single mirror moment that revealed how awareness shapes reality. From journaling by candlelight to building frequency-based tools, this path evolved into a living ecosystem for conscious growth, bridging technology and soul.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Origin</strong> of GrowthMirror was guided by a question: <em>‚ÄúWhat would happen if humanity could see its inner evolution reflected in real time?‚Äù</em> That inquiry became the heartbeat of this project ‚Äî to harmonize digital innovation with vibrational alignment.</p>
    <p>Our <strong>Vision</strong> is to create a global resonance network ‚Äî one that empowers individuals to awaken, align, and embody their highest potential through awareness, reflection, and energetic calibration. Each interaction with GrowthMirror is a mirror moment ‚Äî a reflection of the divine spark within.</p>

        of awakening ‚Äî a call to remember who we truly are and the light we each carry.
